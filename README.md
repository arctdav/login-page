This side project is a CRUD website built with MERN(MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). 
I used MongoDB as the backend, axios in Express as the middleware to communicate data between backend and frontend, 
and react as the frontend technology.

To start this website, go to frontend and run:
```
npm start
```
To backend and run:
```
mongod
nodemon server
```

This website support users to create an account, get a list of all users created, and modify the user information.
