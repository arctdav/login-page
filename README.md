This side project is a CRUD website built with MERN(MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). 
I used MongoDB as the backend, axios in Express as the middleware to communicate data between backend and frontend, 
and react as the frontend technology along with some Bootstrap and JSX.

### Run the website on your local machine
To start this website, go to frontend and run:
```
npm start
```
To backend and run:
```
mongo
> use user
mongod
nodemon server
```

This website support users to create an account, get a list of all users created, and modify the user information.
